Hi there, 

My name is **Bugra Kilic**. I am an engineer working on product and project management of network software solutions at [Argela](https://www.argela.com.tr/en). Plus, I am contributing to [AWS Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com) as a Community Builder for Networking & Content Delivery products.

I have been building network applications in order to improve networking operations and management in the telco business. I use mostly Python, its libraries and related frameworks. I am planning to make all repositories public when the code reaches its stable version. 

For more, please look at [my website](https://bugrakilic.net) and follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bugrakilicnet) and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/bugrakilic).
