### Hi, this is Bugra. 

I am an engineer working on product and project management of network software solutions at [Argela](https://www.argela.com.tr/en). I have been working on Argela network analytics platform lately. Besides, I am contributing to [AWS Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com) as a Community Builder for Networking & Content Delivery products. 

I build Python-based network applications to improve network operations and management in the telco business.
